Contacts-Address-Book-App:

I built a system that manage an contacts address book,using MVC design pattern.
App.java is the main class in this projects.
The app include 2 forms: 
1. Form 1 is the java swing.
2. Form 2 is javaFx.

The app has the following features:

1. Create new contact.
2. Update an existing contact.
3. Browse between the contacts.
4. Export the contacts book to a file: txt file / obj file / byte file.
5. Load the contacts book from a file: txt file / obj file / byte file.
6. Sort your contacts book by first/last name, phone number in ascending/descending order.
