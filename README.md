A system that manage an contacts address book,using MVC design pattern. In working on this project, I try to write it as most modular as I can, by using interfaces and MVC design pattern. App.java is the main class in this projects.

When you run the app, you see 2 forms: form 1 is java swing form 2 is javaFx -> you can see the difference in the view design , and the code of course.

The app has the following features:

Create new contact
Update an existing contact
Browse between the contacts
Export the contacts book to a file -> txt file, obj file and byte file.
Sort your contacts book by first/last name, phone number in ascending/descending order
And more! Enjoy :)
